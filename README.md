# Portfolio Two

This is my second portfolio. I have had my current one well over a year now and I figure it's time for a new one. I will be using some new (to me) technologies, namely next.js and openai.
The plan is to build a more colourful, bold and bright site with more in-built features that I will list below. This is a good oppurtunity to try out a few things I have been working on and
attempt to implement some things that will be benificial in others projects such as Ivy's Game.

# Tech Stack
Frontend - Next.js
Styling - Basic SCSS
Backend - Node.js & Express
AI - Openai
Testing - React Testing Library & Cypress

# Pages
Main - Includes, about me and my work
Blog - Blog page to showcase backend skills, fetching from database etc
Contact - Basic contact details, downloadable CV, chatbot
Possible's - Fun Page(more in features), Interactive CV

# Features (all subject to change
Dark mode/Light mode
Interactive game (undecided which yet) 
AI chabot using openai that speaks like me and answers questions about my projects etc
Dynamic themes, morning night, seasons
Fun Page, basically a parallel universe (can you escape)
Scroll animations, like a storyboard
